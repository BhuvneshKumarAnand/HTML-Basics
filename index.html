	<p1>Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains values referring to â€˜absolute parametersâ€™ such as file names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them so the application can also be run and maintained in a different environment.</p1>

	<p2>Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they are developed while an application is coded.</p2>
