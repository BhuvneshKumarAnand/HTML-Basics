    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect.</p>

    <p>Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some static doâ€™s and donâ€™ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features: maintainability, dependability,
        and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be
        written.
